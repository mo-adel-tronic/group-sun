# Deal with array data in jsx

[print list of items inside ul](../src/components/lists/DealList.js)

# Keys

1. Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.
2. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity
3. not recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.
