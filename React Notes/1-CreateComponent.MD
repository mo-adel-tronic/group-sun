# Create Component

Component Creation Depend on 2 methods:
1. class [Create React Component By Class](../src/components/create/Header/Header.js).
2. function [Create React Component By Function](../src/components/create/Button/Button.js)

**note that you can add component inside component**

**Note: Always start component names with a capital letter.**

React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags. For example, ``<greeting  />`` represents an HTML div tag, but ``<Greeting />`` represents a component and requires Greeting to be in scope.
